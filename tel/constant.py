Hey!
Welcome to linkedin scrapper, are you annoyed by linkedin terrible filters? don't worry, I've got your back!
I have a very cool feature in this bot, I have called it Nested Logical Expression Filter Query.
In a very simple language, you can write your filters and query in pure PYTHON expression!
\n\nFor example, I want to get hird in netherlands where to work as backend engineer with django or fastapi, if there's a vuejs i can work as frontend too, or even full stack, also I want to only work in germany, so how do I write such hard query?
Too easy! ```(django or fastapi) and (backend or (fullstack and vuejs) or (frontend and vuejs)) and germany```
You only need 1 day of python knowledge to write your own logical expression :)
Please use /show command to see all the possible namespaces and keywords you can filter.
You may use /info to check your current query

If you want to setup your filter, simply write it to me here.

Remember, You must be a member of main channel to be able to use this bot:)

Also, don't forget to star my project in github or contribute if you found it cool/useful :)
